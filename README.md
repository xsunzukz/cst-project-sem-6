# Transitioning from XAMPP to Docker

## Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to transition from XAMPP to Docker for your development environment. We have made this change due to occasional issues with XAMPP, such as MySQL crashes, and Docker provides a more consistent and reliable environment across all computers.

## Why Docker?

- Docker ensures consistent performance across different systems.
- It eliminates issues like sudden MySQL crashes that were experienced with XAMPP.
- What works on one system will work seamlessly on all others with Docker.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with Docker and the necessary tools:

### Step 1: Install Docker

1. Visit the Docker website: [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Download and install Docker for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

### Step 2: Clone the Project Repository

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xsunzukz/cst-project-sem-6.git
